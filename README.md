# Boxplot Project

## Objective

The aim of this project is to explain the use of boxplots and demonstrate how they are used by analysing a dataset. I have chosen to use the well known Fisher's Iris Dataset. It is a small, clean dataset which is perfect for analysis. The dataset is made up of quantitative data which makes it suitable for visualisation through the use of boxplot diagrams. By creating boxplots on this dataset I will be able to visualise how the data is distributed. 

## Repository

This repository contains a jupyter notebook called boxplot-project.ipynb. To run this notebook you must have [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. Jupyter comes pre-installed with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python distribution package which I would advise you to install.
